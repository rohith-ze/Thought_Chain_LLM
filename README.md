# Thought_Chain_LLM

Designing a chain-of-thought-based LLM system for solving complex spatial analysis tasks through intelligent geoprocessing orchestration.

## LangChain-powered system that:
  Queries a PostGIS / GeoServer spatial database
  Performs chain-of-thought reasoning to suggest spatial analysis (e.g., buffer, overlay, intersection)
  Executes them via automated geoprocessing (e.g., with pyQGIS or GDAL)

## Add voice/text interface or deploy as a Streamlit / React web app
